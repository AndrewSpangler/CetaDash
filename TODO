HIGH PRIORITY:


 - add workspace logging to container runtime errors (leverage the existing message queue to also write to stdout with context)
 - add action buttons to container view page
 - add layered env to trigger handling
 - fix scheduled trigger workflow dropdown not updating properly

GENERAL:
 - sort logs by timestamp (most recent first)
 - run counts on tasks/triggers etc
 - docker page updates status / color periodically
 - Add delete button to documents / other places
 - add some dashboard tabs
 - back button in changelog

MACROS:
 - move accordians to macros
 - move search bar to macros
 - make search bar standard option on table pages

TRIGGERS:
 - Attached / detached modes
 - Start-if-not-existing
 - stream vs redirect for endpoints in triggers
 - trigger endpoint optional / disabled
 - triggers disabled
 - add box similar to container status for endpoint status
 - make trigger day of week a series of checkboxes in editor

SCHEDULED TRIGGERS: 
 - fix trigger scheduler updates when changes are made
 - run on launch or delayed
 - store info on tasks that were scheduled but haven't run yet for future runs
 - add box similar to container status for trigger status


JSDATATABLES:
 - move jsdatatable buttons to a dropdown
 - attribute-based table factory?


DOCU:
 - write docu
 - link docu to tasks/workflows/triggers

LONG TERM:
 - custom docker labels for cetadash
 - separate proxy setup app
 - containerized script runner (py, js, lua) [network optional]
 - â€œprocess_changes" for logs, acts on before and after dict to generate a changelist
 - ships (for presets)
 - listeners for db edits (like triggers), eg "run container when new user is added to db"
 - TRAEFIK
    - auto-regen traefik acls
 - NETWORK SCANNER / UPTIME MONITOR
    - log scans


figure out db-paginated tables for faster loads (see docu page?)
loading message in tables?
